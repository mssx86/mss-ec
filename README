======
this repository houses precompiled fonts and icons that i've been using daily.
i do not remember the versions neither the sources as i've been moving the same
files from system to system for years.

sometimes i retardingly nuke these and instead of getting them back from a disk
image i thought i'd just put all in a repo.

as a note, adwaita's icons are stripped. some resolutions and scalables are
removed.
